>*Whatever reigns where Seraphim flame and soar,*<br>
>*I beg the, judge not my hand, but what it labored for.*<br>
*No blade was drawn, but wrath still did command,*<br>
>*The tears that yearned to guide my violent hand.*<br>

>*And I, God help me struck not from hate,*<br>
>*But with love inflamed, to seal another's fate.*<br>
>*The blood ran hot. It chilled my chest;*<br>
>*My brother lived. I found no rest.*<br>

>*Weep not for the man who's breath I broke,*<br>
>*But for the law in me, who felt the stroke.*<br>
>*A line I swore I'd never cross,*<br>
>*Shattered by a single toss.*<br>

>*Is this my flaw? Not lust, not prideful thrill,*<br>
>*But mercy's specter, averted by unconscious will?*<br>
>*Lord of grace, of earth, of sea, of sky,*<br>
>*May love lay scourge to Logos, and justify?*<br>

>*Speak not to me now, let silence fan the flame,*<br>
>*For I must bear the weight of a blood-soaked mane.*<br>
>*One soul, now wears the twisted martyrant brand,*<br>
>*Another, now damned for salting mercyâ€™s land.*<br>
