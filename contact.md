### Some Notes
There are some types of question andior comments that would be better directed to other areas. For example, if you're having an issue with my [dot files](https://github.com/makccr/dot) or one of [my projects](https://github.com/makccr) hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com), it would be better in almost every case to simply [create an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/creating-an-issue) on the respective GitHub page; if for no other reason, than the fact that other users will then be able to see whatever issue you were having and perhaps troubleshoot their own issues faster. Likewise if you have a comment about a video I've made, those comments would be best left on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@makc) or [Odysee](https://odysee.com/@makc:a) where you saw the video. 

### Bug Reports
If you are attempting to submit a bug report for this website, first of all, thanks for helping out. Second, the best way to do this would be to [create an issue](https://github.com/makccr/makccr.github.io/issues/new) on this websites repository. If you are unable or unwilling to do so however, feel free to just [send an e-mail](mailto:m@makc.co?subject=bugReport) with "Bug Report" in the subject line (clicking the proceeding link will take care of this for you).

### Social Media Use
Like a lot of people these days, I do make a very concerted effort to spend as little time as possible on social media of every variety. I have deleted nearly every social media account that I used to have. The ones that I still maintain are very rarely interacted with, and used almost exclusively as a means to an end (hosting videos, photos, ext). If you do leave a comment or attempt to contact me via one of these platforms, the odds are that I will not see it at all. While I do appreciate all of the people who view and interact with my content elsewhere on the internet, the downsides of existing in a social media driven world, for me, simply aren't worth it. I do apologize for any inconvenience, but if you have something you'd really like to say, my [e-mail box](mailto:m@makc.co) is always open.

Furthermore, I would love to take the opportunity to encourage anyone and everyone reading this to simply give life without your Instagram, Twitter or Facebook account a shot. I essentially ended up quitting social media cold turkey around 2021 or 2022, and it was easily one of the top 10 decisions I've ever made. I don't want to over sell things -- I'm not suggesting that I stopped using Twitter (or X) and suddenly found instant enlightenment, but my life has improved to a measurable degree. 

*A Note*: It might be considered cheating, but I do actively use services like [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/), [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) and [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/) You won't find me posting any editorial content on these types of sites and services - but my watch/listen/read history always remains public. I quite like the idea of being able to curate some great art for others to engage with.
