<h1><a href="https://makc.co">makc.co</a></h1>
<p>This is the repository for my website. The main goal of the website, is to be a website (duh) - that is to serve as a hub that links to the various projects I've worked on that are available for access online, and a hosting platform to download some of the projects that I have made available for download.</p>
<p>In addition, I like to use this website as a personal kind of a <em>sandbox</em>. For a long time this meant that the website was built exclusively the old fashioned way: no frameworks, no libraries; just straight HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript. If you are interested in that kind of web design, I did produce a little <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avjB5rQMm24&amp;list=PLIYVhRocqRoT6yvieIyNehUz6VnB6hXhF&amp;pp=gAQB">series of videos</a> on my YouTube channel that featured me stumbling through the process of creating a website out out of poorly organized texted documents and crossed fingers.</p>
<p>These days the site is a lot more boring, but also a whole lot lower maintenance. The site is built on the back of <a href="https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/">11ty</a> and uses <a href="https://airtable.com/">Airtable</a> as a sort of a CMS solution for a few of the pages. I have toyed with the idea of making a series of videos that would cover how I managed to put this all together, but in the meantime this repository should serve as at least some kind of instruction.</p>
<p><em>P.S.</em>: If you're interested in a series of video on the current iteration of my site, feel free to <a href="mailto:m@makc.co:">e-mail</a> me to let that request be known; and be sure to keep and eye on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@makc">YouTube channel</a> just in case I publish something without telling anyone...</p>
