        <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
<h3>as of the 10th of August 2025</h3>
<h3></h3>
<h2>Ownership of Site; Agreement to Terms of Use</h2>
<p>These Terms and Conditions of User apply to my (Mackenzie Criswell) personal website located at <a href="https://makc.co">https://makc.co</a>. This site is the property of me (Mackenzie Criswell). BY USING THIS WEBSITE, YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF USE; IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT USE THIS WEBSITE.</p>
<h2>Your Use of this Site</h2>
<p>You MAY use any &quot;deep-link&quot;, &quot;page-scrape&quot;, &quot;robot&quot;, &quot;spider&quot; or other automatic device, program, algorithm or methodology, or any similar or equivalent manual process, to access, acquire, copy or monitor any portion of the Site or any Content, or in any way reproduce or circumvent the navigational structure or presentation of the Site or any Content, to obtain or attempt to obtain any materials, documents or information through any means not purposely made available through the Site. For all intents and purposes: consider this site a playground andior sandbox, as I can assure you that is how I view it. I don't care what you do with the data available on this site.</p>
<p>You may attempt to gain unauthorized access to any portion or feature of the Site, or any other systems or networks connected to the Site, by hacking, password &quot;mining&quot; or any other illegitimate means. There are no unauthorized parts of this website, have fun.</p>
<p>Officially my Site's GitHub repository specifically is protected under the <a href="https://github.com/makccr/makccr.github.io?tab=MIT-1-ov-file">MIT License</a>, the full text of which is below:</p>
<p>Copyright (c) <script>document.write(/\d{4}/.exec(Date())[0])</script> Mackenzie Criswell</p>
<p>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.</p>
<p>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.</p>
<h3>All of that being said, feel free to explore and have fun, but please don't try to take the Site down.</h3>
<p>I encourage you to treat this site like the Wal-Mart parking lot where people go to learn how to drive as teenagers. Screw around, learn, experiment; but keep in mind reasonable limits. Even in the Wal-Mart parking lot, if you start doing burn-outs, someone is going to call the cops. I quite like the idea of my site being a <em>free-for-all</em>; but if things ever get to the point that it requires constant attention from me, I'll have to switch some things up.</p>
<h2>Functionality &amp; Accessibility</h2>
<p>As mentioned in the above section, any user is free to use any automated system to crawl this website, for whatever reason they might see fit. Clearly this spirit extents to screen readers or any other software that might be used to &quot;crawl&quot; or &quot;scrape&quot; this Site's data in order to enable use by individuals with visual disabilities. I (Mackenzie Criswell) have made some efforts to make this process easier on the back-end of the Site. But if anyone has any additional recommendations or ideas in regard to increasingly accessibility, those ideas should be directed to the Site's GitHub page in the form of <a href="https://github.com/makccr/makccr.github.io/issues/new">opening an Issue</a>--or, if you are unable or unwilling to do this, by submitting a <a href="https://makc.co/contact">Bug Report</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to accessibility feature requests or bug reports, all other technical or theoretical requests can be directed to the same, aforementioned repositories.</p>

<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<h3>as of the 25th of September 2025</h3>
<h2>Collection and Use of Personal Information</h2>
<p>I do not collect any personal information from the users of this website. I do take this quite seriously, as I really hate browsing the modern web. Nearly every modern website is absolutely loaded with a novel's worth of JavaScript running in the background that is collecting your information and/or feeding you ads. I do not participate in the data collection norm that we have come to expect from the modern web. I do not have any ads on my website, because I don't want third parties collecting data on users. I don't collect any kind of cookies, because I don't know how to. If you require evidence of this, my website is 100% open-source, and the entirety of the source code can be viewed on my site's <a href="https://github.com/makccr/makccr.github.io">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>While I do take privacy quite seriously, there are a number of third party services that I utilize in order to keep this website running, who, as you would expect, have varying degrees of commitment to user privacy. I do take into account the reputation of services that I utilize for my website. On the occasions that a third-party service's actions become unreasonable or egregious I am committed to finding an alternative solution. If you would like to assist in this regard, my <a href="/contact">contact information</a> is readily available, and thank you in advance.</p>
<p>In an effort to make things easier for the end-user I have compiled a list of all the services that help keep this Site afloat, with links to their respective privacy policies:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.netlify.com/privacy/">Netlify</a> - My hosting solution</li>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq/privacy">Google Fonts</a> - Serves fonts to my site</li>
<li><a href="https://fontawesome.com/privacy">Font Awesome</a> - Serves icons to my site</li>
<li><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> - A front-end toolkit that I use basically just for additional icons</li>
<li><a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/privacy/">Eleventy</a> - A static site generator that I use to compile my website</li>
<li><a href="https://www.airtable.com/company/privacy">Airtable</a> - An online database platform that I use as a sort-of a CMS solution</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the third party services I use, I have also compiled a quick collection of privacy policies for all of the social media sites that are linked to from this website: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/our-commitments/protecting-user-data/">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://help.odysee.tv/communityguidelines/">Odysee</a>, <a href="https://unsplash.com/privacy">Unsplash</a>, <a href="https://inv.nadeko.net/privacy">Invidioius</a>.</p>
