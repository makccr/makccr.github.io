<h1>Consequences Are More Important Than Actions</h1>
<h3>July 21, 2025</h3>

<div class="essayContainer"> 
<p>Here's an interesting thought experiment: <em>What if no one had stopped Rosa Parks? No police. No outrage. Just silence. Would we still remember her name?</em></p>
<p>To re-cap basic civil rights history in America; the Rosa Parks <em>incident</em> and her following arrest, along with several other sit-in type demonstrations launched America into a decade long period of turmoil over so-called <em>Jim Crowe</em> laws. Ultimately there was a massive change in the legal status quo in America, a constitutional amendment passed, and a generational shift that was set in motion-All from one woman breaking an unjust law.</p>
<p>But what would have happened, if, when Rosa Parks and others started their silent protests, no one did anything? No one attempted to stop her in any way? No one called the police? Everyone just kind of looked down at their newspaper or magazine and went on about their day as if nothing had happened?</p>
<p>There are plenty of completely absurd laws that are still in the books in America. Remnants from another time, that are still technically law, but that no one would think to actually enforce. Even when it comes to something like Marijuana legalization, the precarious situation that this drug finds itself in is at least in part due to the way that law enforcement on a state-by-state basis is incredibly spastic in how they prosecute these types of crimes. Even before legalization became law in states where it is, plenty of individual communities enjoyed effective legalization through a lack of willingness to enforce the law. There is no guarantee that a law will be revoked, simply because it's unjust or isn't actively being enforced--they don't come with an expiration date.</p>
<p>What I'm getting at here is a principle that I've believed for a long time: <em>If you're going to break a rule, you need to be prepared to face the consequences of that action.</em> This is not because it's the morally just position to try and make oneself into a martyr, rather, because it's not the actual rule breaking that leads to change, but the consequences that one faces for doing to. <em>Martyrdom</em> is what transforms protest into legacy.</p>
<p>Another question; why do we still remember who Jesus was? Why do we remember Socrates? It's not as if there weren't other prophets and philosophers before them. It's not as if their weren't a multitude of both that came after their respective deaths. Neither made any real effort to preserve their legacy, by even bothering to write down their ideas. There's a pretty good chance that Jesus was illiterate. Yet they inspired disciples who were more than willing to do the documentary leg-work for them. So why do we remember these men? Why were they able to inspire a multitude of disciples? It has nothing to do with their ideas, their ideas were shared by many before and after their time. We remember them because of the unjust punishments that they faced for professing those ideas. If neither had been executed by their respective governing bodies, we'd likely have no idea who either was.</p>
<p>Ghandi leading the salt march-without the beatings, would it have mattered? The Stonewall Riots, without the police crackdown? Without visible challenge and consequence, unjust laws fade quietlyâ€”never truly discredited, just dormant. What goes dormant can always return.</p>
<p>A rule without enforcement is just a piece of a paper. A law is only a law as long as there is someone who is willing to prosecute it. Both are made increasingly unstable by an increase in authoritarian actions. Unjust laws don't fall because people break them, they fall because power insists on punishing those people, and in doing so, exposes itself.</p>
