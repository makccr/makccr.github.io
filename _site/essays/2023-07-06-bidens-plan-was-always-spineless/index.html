        <h2>A Position on Student Loans I Didn't Think I'd Ever Have</h2>
<p>A few days ago The Supreme Court ruled against a plan Joe Biden had to forgive a few billion dollars worth of federally held student loans via executive order. A few years ago I think I might have done what several people are doing now: been outraged at the Supreme Court's decision here; but I'm not the same me I was a few years ago.</p>
<p>I want to be clear that I actually do think that absolving a lot of student debt is a good move. There's a little over a trillion dollars of student loan debt being held in the US between federally owned and privately owned debt. This is not a good situation for anyone. A person being trapped under debt that they most likely will not pay back in their lifetime is a huge burden on the economy as a whole. Much the same as people who are living pay-check to pay-check, people who are living under cumbersome debt simply aren't contributing to the economy the way that debt-free ones aren't. This is of course stressful and a huge burden on an individual, but also does make everyone poorer: business can't make as much if no one has any buying power, and it doesn't take long for money to simply be re-distributed to a few wealthy people at the top of the economic <em>food chain</em>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I don't view many of these partakers in the college system to be entirely at fault. There is a question here of personal responsibility. Many people simply went to school and buried themselves in crippling debt for degrees that aren't even really doing them that much good in the job market. But I think it's important to acknowledge that this is very much what students have been <em>told</em> to do as part of US public education for decades now. Much of High School level education in the United States is geared towards preparing students for further education in college and not teaching them real skills. I'm a big believer that many would be better served by a school system that teaches maths and sciences, but also budgeting and health more predominantly. But I have a hard time viewing people who followed the path that was pitched to them for twelve years straight as less than victims of a broken system.</p>
<p>All of that being said, it was a terrible idea from the get-go to simply try and forgive massive amounts of student debt without addressing the underlying problems that created this system in the first place. I've come to the opinion that a lot of the big government funded program pitches like single-payer health-care and federally funded higher education in particular are a game of timing more than anything else. Much the same way that I wrote about my personal struggle with prioritization a little while ago[^8], properly prioritizing how these problems are solved is absolutely vital for their success.</p>
<p>[^8]: Referencing: <em>Volume VIII</em> | 10:48 - Wed, Jun 28, 2023</p>
<p>In the case of single-payer health-care: it would be something very close to <em>pointless</em> to simply institute an UK style NHS system and then walk away. The entire point of having a single-payer is to provide an ultimate position of bargaining power in which the people can simply refuse to pay an absorbent amount for health services. If the only change made to health care is that the government picks up the tab for health services rather than insurances companies all you've done is eliminate a tons of jobs in a massive industry and done nothing about the actual cost of health care. The system only works if you force hospitals to change their practice of spending huge amounts of payroll on unnecessary administrative labor; and especially forcing pharmaceutical companies to charge a reasonable rate for commonly used drugs.</p>
<p>Much the same way, simply forgiving student debt doesn't do anything buy cost the tax payers a stupid amount of money in the short term and provide no benefit in the long term. You have to also fix the same problems in the college industry: outrageous spending on administrative employees, and all the rest of things that have made the price of a college education go from something that could reasonably afford when my parents and grandparents were in their prime, to the most expensive purchase a lot of people will ever make in their lifetime, save for a house. Though it's starting to seem more unlikely that the average person in my generation will be able to afford both a house and a college education in their life-time.</p>
<p>This was a spineless position on Biden's part from the start. If you're going to forgive student loans and also do some work to force colleges to bring their prices down to a reasonable price point, that's one thing. But this was never Biden's intention. The plan was to simply force the tax payers to bail out students and then move on.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that I even necessarily have a huge problem with this. After the auto-industry, banks, airlines, and Ukraine all being bailed out to the tune of billions of dollars in the past few decades; I think it's a little bit hypocritical for people to decide that bailing out students is just a <em>bridge to far</em> all of a sudden. But that doesn't change the fact that it's an objectively stupid way to <em>pretend</em> to solve the problem. The same way that it was stupid to bail out banks in 2008 without forcing any reform, and airlines in 2021 during COVID without any requirements that they make changes -- it's absurd to put a bail-out band-aid on college debt without doing any work to solve the underlying problems that created the broken system.</p>
<p>It wouldn't be the worst thing in the world had Biden's plan actually gone through. America is the richest country in the world, and while we can't afford anything and everything -- I think there is a case to be made that this is an investment that would have paid for itself. If you release some percentage of the population from crippling debt, their buying power increases, the entire economy does better for it. I don't know that forgiving the $200 billion in debt (or whatever the figure was) would have certainly paid for itself in five years or something with contributions to the economy that it would enable. I also am not sure where I come down the idea that The Supreme Court has the power to block Biden's executive order here, or whether or not this is the kind of expenditure that falls under the power of the executive order.</p>
<p>What I am certain about is the complete and total lack of courage displayed by everyone involved here. There is a reason that Biden moved to forgive student debt, rather than, for example, pull federal funding from schools unless they drop tuition rates: its inoffensive to all the stakeholders. Forgiving student debt isn't going to take any money from schools, and will only encourage them to continue <em>as they were</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Sum-up:</strong> I wouldn't be mad at all if a big chunk of student loan debt was forgiven, I do think it's a great idea. However, the simple spinelessness displayed by Biden and crew here to just throw money at a problem with no intention of actually fixing it is absurd. I'm exhausted watching the US government as a whole continue to waste money to the tune of billion of dollars to provide <em>fake fixes</em> for problems that only they really have the power to properly fix. This is true for everything thing from Airlines, to Ukraine, to student debt.</p>
