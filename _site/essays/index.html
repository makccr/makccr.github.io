<a href="/essays/2025-03-15-harvard-classics/"><h2>The Best Value in the History of Literature</h2></a>
<p class="date">March 2025</p>
<p>I can't remember exactly when or how I first came across "The Harvard Classics", but ever since that day I have been on a mission to get my hands on a set. The Classics, originally published as "Dr. Elliot's Five Foot Shelf of Books" is an absolutely massive, fifty-one volume collection of novels, poetry, history, philosophy, scientific writing, historical documents, and anything else that Dr. Elliot deemed necessary reading to establish a well-rounded liberal education. But the size of the collection isn't what's really special about it. Any fool could copy and paste some books into one Word Document and hit print...</p>

<p class="date">July 2023</p>
<p>A few days ago The Supreme Court ruled against a plan Joe Biden had to forgive a few billion dollars worth of federally held student loans via executive order. A few years ago I think I might have done what several people are doing now; been outraged at the Supreme Court's decision here; but I'm not the same me I was a few years ago...</p>

<a href="/essays/2019-12-05-vim-the-best-markdown-editor/"><h2>Vim, The Best Markdown Editor</h2></a>
<p class="date">December 2019</p>
<p>Before I start writing any opinions here, I’d like to take a second to talk about why I think I’m qualified to say what the best markdown editor is; and what my criteria in choosing a markdown editor looks like. There is no shortage of blogs and articles out there that seek to answer this very question, so I wouldn’t expect anyone to just be taking my word for it, without knowing if my word has any value to you, or the way that you want to work...</p>

<a href="/essays/2019-07-02-the-crusade-for-a-better-darkmode/"><h2>The Crusade for a Better Dark Mode</h2></a>
<p class="date">July 2019</p>
<p>I couldn’t exactly tell you why, but I care a great deal about the progress of dark modes on modern software platforms. But I kind of always have hated the way that this feature is baked into software and websites. Almost always, you open a new app, or website; and at some point you realize you’d like to go into dark mode; so you fish around in the settings and menus looking for a button to do just that for you; or maybe you even get desperate and just Google the answer — the point is it’s a frustrating process. Every app, every web site, ever OS has a manual button that you, the user, have to go and track down. Of course that’s just the process for enabling the dark mode, turning it back off it equally annoying...</p>

<a href="/essays/2019-04-30-why-you-should-watch-the-incredible-hulk-before-you-watch-avengers-endgame/"><h2>Why You Should Watch “The Incredible Hulk” Before You See “Avengers Endgame”</h2></a>
<p class="date">April 2019</p>
<p>I just got back from Avengers Endgame, and it was pretty incredible. It took advantage of its three hour run time in a way I never expected, and formed itself into a quiet contemplation of the MCU’s past events. But, what surprised me about the film more than anything else, was the way that no single character felt short shrifted in the film. Of course the biggest complaint that I heard about the penultimate film, “Avengers Infinity War”, was how the film moved quickly and glossed over important character moments. But somehow, in a film with perhaps more characters in the script than any other film in history, this was not the case with “Avengers Endgame”...</p>

<a href="/essays/2018-10-19-why-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-is-the-worst-movie/"><h2>Why The Prisoner of Azkaban is the Worst Movie</h2></a>
<p class="date">October 2018</p>
<p>If you have read any reviews for the Harry Potter films online, you probably know that Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, is widely considered to be the best of the films. The praise for this movie off the charts. It has 91% on Rotten Tomatoes (a score beaten only by The Deathly Hallows Pt.2, at 94%), Roger Ebert gave it 3.5/4 starts, the film has high reviews on basically every movie rating platform out there, MetaCritic, IMDb, ext. If you google the movie, the top voted tags, are “magical”, “must watch”, “clever”, and “intense”; one of my favorite YouTuber’s, the Nerd Writer even made a video about why he believes The Prisoner of Azkaban to be the best movie...</p>
