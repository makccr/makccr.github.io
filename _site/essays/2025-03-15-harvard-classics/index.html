<p>I can't remember exactly when or how I first came across &quot;The Harvard Classics&quot;, but ever since that day I have been on a mission to get my hands on a set. The Classics, originally published as: &quot;Dr. Elliot's Five Foot Shelf of Books&quot; is an absolutely massive, fifty-one volume collection of novels, poetry, history, philosophy, scientific writing, historical documents, and anything else that Dr. Elliot deemed necessary reading to establish a well-rounded liberal education. But the size of the collection isn't what's really special about it. Any fool could copy and paste 200 books into one Word Document and hit print.</p>
<p>Rather, &quot;The Harvard Classics&quot; is actually the most unique and complete collection of literature I've every encountered. The collection was put together by Charles William Elliot, who was the President of Harvard from 1869-1909, during a period that really could be considered a golden age for American Academia. Really, Elliot was probably one of the better positioned people to actually be able to accurately make decisions about what would fit into the category of <em>required reading</em>. It honestly shouldn't be surprising at all then that The classics contain virtually all of the most influential works of the past three centuries (at least up to 1909), as well as a massive amount of literature pre-dating that as well.</p>
<p>Just as a thought experiment, I opened up the table of contents, and made a not of everything that I had either read and thought was valuable, or had heard of in high esteem; and probably had some intention of reading at some point in the future if I actually remembered to do it. That list ended up being so long that it's probably a bad idea to actually read out the whole thing here, but I actually can't think of a better way to illustrate my point.</p>
<p>The first volume includes:
The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin, and
Fruits of Solitude,</p>
<p>of course that seems like a weak way to start collection when you open up volume two and realize that it contains, yabe not the entire collected works of both Plato and Epictetus, but a massive amount of their writing - as well as, everyone's favorite stoic field guide: &quot;Meditations&quot;. Keep in mind that Socrates actually never bothered to write anything down, and basically all of his teachings we have because they were documented by his student: Plato. So really You have a volume completely dedicated to Socrates, Plato and Epictetus; basically the three biggest power-houses of ancient Greek philosophy - and arguably three of the most influential figures in all of history.</p>
<p>The next three volumes are dedicated to the collected works of John Milton, then Ralph Waldo Emerson, then Robert Burns, respectively.</p>
<p>And throughout the remaining 45 volumes, in no particular order of importance you'll find:
The Confessions from Augustine of Hippo
The Imitation of Christ
Agamenon
The Wealth of Nations
The Origin of Species
Plutarch's Lives
The Ã†neid
Pilgrim's Progress
The Divine Comedy
Don Quixote
The Odyssey
The Voyage of the Beagle
Machiaveli's &quot;The Prince&quot;
Beowulf
The Song of Roland
The Shoemaker's Holiday
The Alchemist
Uncle Tom's Cabin
Pride and Prejudice
The Astroleger</p>
<p>David Copperfield, that's the Charles Dickens novel &quot;David Copperfield&quot; not a book about the magician who maybe of maybe wasn't hanging out on Epstein island</p>
<p>The Mill on the Floss
The Scarlet Letter
The Portrait of a Lady
The Hunchback of Notre Dame
Anna Karennia
Ivan the Fool
Fyodor Dostoyevsky's &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; (only Crime and Punsihment though, oddly enough)</p>
<p>writings from
John Locke
Berkely
Hume
Descartes
Shakespear
Voltaire
Thomas Hobbes
Pacal
Lord Byron
Faust
Euripides
Virgil and
Confucious</p>
<p>a complete collection of Fables from
Aesop
The Brothers's Grimm
and Anderson</p>
<p>The Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution, obviously
But also:
The Mayflower Compact
The First Charter of Virginia
Washington's Farewell Address
The Treaty with Great Britain (the one following the Revolution and the one following the war of 1812)
The Monroe Doctrine
The Federalist Papers
The Fugitive Slave Act
The Emancipation Proclamation
The Gettysburg Address
and even the Terms of Robert E. Lee's surrender</p>
<p>Finally, you've got not only some love for western religion, with inclusions of
The Book of Job
Pslams
Esslesiastes
as well as
The Gospels according to Luke
and The Acts of the Apostiles</p>
<p>but you also have several passages from The Koran
as well as The Bhagavad-Gita</p>
<p>I think it's clear why I was so interested in this collection. If you threw in a copy of &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot; and some Cormac McCarthy novels, I'd basically have everything I'd want to read for the rest of my life in one collection.</p>
<p>But as you can imagine, actually getting your hands on a physical copy of the collection is a bit of an investment. For a while I really couldn't find anywhere that would sell a full-set for less than 4 figures; but eventually I found some eBay sellers who were actually willing to part with their collection for exceedingly reasonable prices. However shipping is still a bit complex, to say the least, and I'm only really wiling to drive so far to pick up some books-- none of that's really relevant though, because you can get the whole thing for $1.
I'm not even making that app. Completely randomly I was messing around on my Kobo eReader a few days ago, and searched for &quot;Harvard Classics&quot; in the store, expecting to find nothing. I found a result claiming to be the full set, but also on sale from it's normal price of $1.99, for .99. I literally bought the eBook expecting it to be, maybe the first volume, or worse, somebody writing a book about the collection. But when I opened the book, I found that I now had access not only to the original 51 volumes; but also an additional 20 volumes that were published in 1917 under the title: The Harvard Classics Shelf of Fiction (which is exactly what it sounds like).</p>
<p>To be clear this isn't some kind of freak deal in the Kobo store. This same collection is $1.99 if you buy if from Barnes &amp; Noble for a Nook, $1.99 in the Google Play Store, $1.99 from Apple Books; and please have enough self-respect not to buy it from Amazon -- but it's also .99 in the Kindle Store.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong the collection is more than worth the three or four hundred bucks I'd have to pay to get my physical copy, and I'll probably still end up buying my own set. But if it's worth $400 it's definately worth paying $2 for. I can't think of a single other place where you could aquire this quantity of literature for literally less than the price of a pack of a gum. Maybe this isn't such a horrible time to be alive after all -- tik-tik</p>
