<div class="essayContainer"> 
<p>A couple of days ago Donald Trump's administration, probably mostly under the leadership of current Secretary of State Marco Rubio performed an operation in Venezuela in which a Delta Force unit was sent in to kidnap the President of Venezuela Nicolás Maduro and his wife. There were also some bombs dropped in the nation, and between the bombing and the Delta team's operation to arrest the president, around eighty people total were killed. But, for all intents and purposes the plan seems to have gone off in precisely the way that it was intended to by Trump and crew. Maduro was brought to New York to stand trial (though it's not clear for what exactly yet), and just today the Trump team announced that they they were ordering Venezuela's current acting leadership to hand over 30 or so million barrels of oil to the United States, and even seized what was apparently a Russian ship that had been blocked from entering Venezuela during the previous month or so long blockade and bombing campaign that has been carried out by the US military in the waters near Venezuela's coast.</p>
<p>This is, I think <em>objectively</em> one of the most absurd positions America's military has ever found itself in. I do want to spend some more time talking specifically about what the potential ramifications of this action might be in the future; but for now I want to take a different angle and talk instead about how this is simply a logical extension of the way that political elites in America have thought of and continue to think about foreign policy since at least the end of WW2, and, if I'm being honest, even before that.</p>
<p>See, I don't think I've talked a ton about foreign policy in these essays, really ever; but, importantly, this is not because it's a subject that hasn't held my interest over the last decade. Rather, I have to, with great shame admit, that this is an area in which I have bought into propaganda put out by people who claim to know far more about the world than the average American citizen. I think this position was summed up quite well in a recent interview I saw from Hillary Clinton in which she continued to espouse support for Israel in the fact of it's occupation and genocide of the Gaza strip. In the interview she basically refused to actually make any case for why her position was the correct one, and simply went on a rant about how horrible it was that young people were getting new and opinions about the Israeli's military action from sources on social media, and not the <em>proper</em> channels like traditional new outlets who, in her paraphrased words: are able to talk about Israel's current actions with the proper historical context.</p>
<p>I have written at least one entry already about how I was betrayed by precisely this lie. A promise from commentators and reporters who I actually do have a decent amount of intellectual respect for (people like Sam Harris and Bill Maher come to mind), who have promised relentlessly that any unsavory opinions about Israel's occupation of Palestine could be remedied simply by spending more time gathering a better understanding of the unabridged and complete history of the conflict. In the case of Israel, I am sad to admit that I found this argument very compelling. To some extent this was due to the obvious hypocrisy that at the time seemed to wild to be hypocrisy. A really great example of this does come from the commentary of Sam Harris specifically, a thinker who I have respected for most of the time that I have been maintaining my collection of treatises about the world. Harris is a fervent Atheist who has argued relentlessly against religious influence over government bodies; particularly Christian and Muslim influence over American and European government bodies. Harris made that point so eloquently that when he made precisely the opposite claim about Israel, suggesting that due to it's history that the totalitarian Jewish state of Israel was probably the only state in the history of the world that had an inherent right to exist as a totalitarian state - I thought that clearly there must have been something I had to be missing.
That assumption, I'm all by completely sure now, was false. What seemed like a hypocrisy far to wild to actually just be a hypocrisy - was precisely that. I have spent years researching, listening to every viewpoint possible, and actively trying propagandize myself of the Zionist position. But there is no squaring that circle. America has propped up what is perhaps the most evil group of actors in the middle-east for decades now; and all the while, common Americans who failed to fall for the same propaganda as the evangelicals have been painted as morons and told that we simply didn't have a full enough understanding of the history behind this situation. A compelling argument, considering that the history goes back basically all the way back to the origins of written history; but an absurd one none the less.</p>
<p>But this isn't just an entry about Americans involvement with Israel. This is about America's military interventionism and attempts at regime change, occupation, andior influence in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Cuba, China, Russia, Ukraine and, to be frank, literally every other nation outside of America in which American troops have ever touched the soil, at least since the end of WW2, though the history certainly goes back even further than that. What's most concerning however is not the way in which America has acted every bit as imperialist as the mother country that we once fought for independence from; but rather the way in which a political elite, for at least 100 years have convinced average Americans that we are all simply wrong for criticizing our own government (the first right guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights), every single time an interventionist war has come up.</p>
<p>Now, there are plenty of reasons in which a member of the political or capitalist elite might actively want to pursue a war. One of the most well known in recent history is simply the fact that was is incredibly profitable for a good deal of industries. WW2 was profitable enough to pull the entire nation of The United States out of the depression of the 1930's. But in recent years business elites have become much more skilled at simply not distributing wealth properly. While nations of old went to war to rape and plunder the resources of their neighboring nations, modern America has become skilled at doing precisely the exact same thing. Probably the most glaringly obvious example of this was George Bush II's invasion of Iraq, which was led by Dick Cheney and others who profited to the tune of billions when we plundered Iraqi land. Though the Trump administration's recent action in Venezuela might ultimately end up taking the cake when it comes to the award for <em>most obvious war designed as a cash grab</em> when historians document this situation. Already reports have come out that claim that oil executives at Exxon Mobile and the like were informed of the military action before it took place, while the opposition party leadership found out about the Delta Force operation the same way I did; reading about it after it had already happened. At least Bush's administration went through the sound and dance of lying about weapons about mass destruction and passing a vote through Congress to allow their military adventurism.</p>
<p>But I think there is a point that is far more central to America's favorite investment and pass-time or war; one that is often over-looked. Actually, it occurs to me while writing about this how long I've been unconsciously thinking about this issue, and just not ever properly putting it into words. What I'm talking about here is essentially a bastardized and corrupted view of what was originally coined by founding fathers like John Adams as <em>The Monroe Doctrine</em>. This was back in the good old days of my Republic of birth. Not so much in the sense that everything America was doing at the time was great, we were still heavily participating in the chattel slavery market at the time after all, but when the American elite were still a scrappy group of revolutionaries who had just emancipated themselves from the imperialism and oppression of their former British overlords. The argument that originally spawned The Monroe Doctrine was not that America had some inherent right or responsibility to engage in the same imperialist war mongering action of their mother country; but simply an acknowledgment that other nations and over governments had influence over the territories and lands that they occupied. This simple idea led to America assisting in various South American nations to free smaller nations of imperialist rule of countries like Spain, France and Great Britain; sometimes with influence, sometimes with force; it led to American pioneers chasing the idea of <em>westward expansion</em> and pushing on, expanding America from it's original strip of land in New England, all the way across a continent and too a border and entirely different ocean from the one pilgrims first arrived on.</p>
<p>I want to be clear here, because it does sound a bit like I'm romanticizing the idea of The Monroe Doctrine here, and that is by no means what I meant to do. America's expansion undeniably came with massive consequences for the rest of the world. Whether were talking about our own genocide of Native Americans, or our war with Mexico over the territory that would later become my home state of Texas; or any number of other example we can point to in which America's mission to gather more territory has come not from legitimate purchases like was the case of the Louisiana territory or Alaska; but through often times brutal military action that was every bit as imperialist as the nation that we once fought for freedom from. The only point that I'm aiming to make is that I genuinely do not think that when the Monroe Doctrine was first conceived, that it was conceived to be used as an excuse to simply invade any land and take and resource that the military, political or capitalist elite happened to fancy. Early American military action took place with great trepidation and only after massive debate from a group of individuals who had experienced first hand the subjugation of a world super power. I bring this all up to say simply that there is a reason that you can walk through countless South American and European countries and see statues of George Washington. For a brief moment America was not a world super power that was every bit as evil as the people they freed themselves from; but rather a rag-tag group of patriots who believed in Freedom above all else, and inspired Independence in countless nations around the world.</p>
<p>Power has a way of corrupting even the most noble of ideas though. It should be no shock that The Monroe Doctrine has become bastardized by a group of people who want nothing more than to pump and dumb every nation for their own profit. Whether it's philosophical, governmental or even theological there has never once been an ideal articulated so clearly that it hasn't been stolen and contorted into a justification for some great evil by bad actors down the line. It was true when Ayn Rand bastardized Nietzsche. It was true when the Catholic Church bastardized Jesus. And it's been true every time a power hungry capitalist or political leader has bastardized the words and intent of our founding fathers to justify a horrific action. What's unfortunate now is that I'm forced to admit that as much as I love the early history of our nation, the idealistic writings of men like Adams, Jefferson and Franklin; the nation they founded has become every bit as corrupt and imperialist as the nation they fought to escape. It has been for years. There is no greater understanding of history or some special unknown context that makes any of this make sense. We, as a nation of sacrificed everything in the name of war. It is our single greatest export. We no longer manufacturer anything, we don't influence, we simply invade, rape, plunder and leave every land we touch worse than we found it; we've become precisely the thing that we were founded to fight against.</p>
