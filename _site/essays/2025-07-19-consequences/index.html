<h1>Consequences Are More Important Than Actions</h1>
<h3>July 18, 2025</h3>

<div class="essayContainer"> 
<p>Here's an interesting thought experiment that I ran in my head the other day: <em>What would have happened is when Rosa Parks attempted to sit in the whites only section of her bus, no-one tried to stop her?</em></p>
<p>To re-cap basic civil rights history in America. The Rosa Parks <em>incident</em> and her following arrest, along with a few other sit-in type demonstrations launch America into a decades long period of turmoil over so-called <em>Jim Crowe</em> laws on the books. Due to highly publicized riots and police abuse taking place on American streets, all of black and white America was forced to take a look at the absurdity of blatantly racist laws on the books. Particularly young Americans are unable to support such absurd laws, and all things considered the legal status-quo is changed at a fairly rapid pace.</p>
<p>But what if, rather than the huge upset at these original series of sit-in type protests, and Rosa Parks specifically -- no-one attempted to stop her? To put it another way: what if racists laws existed, an yet they were never actually enforced? There are plenty of ridiculous laws that are technically on the books, but not actively enforced. Marijuana's precarious legal situation, I think is largely due to the fact that laws concerning the drug are at best, spastic in their enforcement; to the extent that just about every president that has held the office in my life-time has openly admitted to using what is, according to DEA policy, one of the most dangerous drugs on the planet.</p>
<p>What I'm getting at is a principle that I've believed for a very long time: Most of the time you should follow the rules, except when you shouldn't. But when you are going to break a rule, you should be prepared to face the consequences. This is not because its somehow the morally just thing to do to behave like a martyr and accept unjust punishment; but rather because its not the actual breaking of rules that leads to change, but the consequences doled out upon the rule breakers that does so. A law without enforcement is just text on a paper, and not actually a law: Laws are only laws as long as their is someone willing to enforce them.</p>
<p>This of course assumes that any rule-breaking (law-breaking) is taking place because an individual assumes a rule to be unjust; and not just because their is some psychotic need felt to break the rules just for the sake of breaking rules.  But, of course law-breaking or rule-breaking to moral ends is really the only type of rule-breaking that can be supported at any length.</p>
