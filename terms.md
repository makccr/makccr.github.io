## Ownership of Site; Agreement to Terms of Use
These Terms and Conditions of User apply to my (Mackenzie Criswell) personal website located at [https://makc.co](https://makc.co). This site is the property of me (Mackenzie Criswell). BY USING THIS WEBSITE, YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF USE; IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT USE THIS WEBSITE. 

## Your Use of this Site
You may use any "deep-link", "page-scrape", "robot", "spider" or other automatic device, program, algorithm or methodology, or any similar or equivalent manual process, to access, acquire, copy or monitor any portion of the Site or any Content, or in any way reproduce or circumvent the navigational structure or presentation of the Site or any Content, to obtain or attempt to obtain any materials, documents or information through any means not purposely made available through the Site. For all intents and purposes: consider this site a playground andior sandbox, as I can assure you that is how I view it. I don't care what you do with the data available on this site.

You may attempt to gain unauthorized access to any portion or feature of the Site, or any other systems or networks connected to the Site, by hacking, password "mining" or any other illegitimate means. There are no unauthorized parts of this website, have fun.

### All of that being said, feel free to explore and have fun, but please don't try to take my site down.

I encourage you to treat this site like the Wal-Mart parking lot where people go to learn how to drive as teenagers. Screw around, learn, experiment; but keep in mind reasonable limits. Even in the Wal-Mart parking lot, if you start doing burn-outs, someone is going to call the cops. I quite like the idea of my site being a free-for-all; but if things ever get to the point that it requires constant attention from me, I'll have to switch some things up.

## Accessibility
As mentioned in the above section, any user is free to use any automated system to crawl this website, for whatever reason. In the context of accessibility, I'm mainly talking about screen readers. But this section doesn't exist just for me to say that users have the right to use a screen reader, that should be assumed. Mainly I just want to mention the things I've done with my site to try and make it more accessible. If you have any additional ideas, as to how I can make my site more accessible, please feel free to direct those to the [bug report](/contact) page.

So what have I done to make the site more accessible? The main focus is making sure that my site is easy to navigate via they keyboard. This mainly involved adding title tags to any links, so that they can be read by screen-readers; and adding alternate text to image tags, for the same reason. I've also put some thought into the color-scheme on this site. I wan't to provide a reasonable amount of contrast for users with vision impairments. The site also functions with both a light and dark theme, that is triggered via a CSS media query, and should follow the operating system setting for the end user.

# Privacy Policy
### as of April 5, 2025
## Collection and Use of Personal Information
I do not collect any personal information from the users of this website. I do take this quite seriously, as I really hate browsing the modern web. Nearly every modern website is absolutely loaded with a novel's worth of JavaScript running in the background that is collecting your information and/or feeding you ads. I do not participate in the data collection norm that we have come to expect from the modern web. I do not have any ads on my website, because I don't want third parties collecting data on users. I don't collect any kind of cookies, because I don't know how to. If you require evidence of this, my website is 100% open-source, and the entirety of the source code can be viewed on my site's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/makccr/makccr.github.io).

## Third-Party Services
While I do take privacy quite seriously, there are a number of third party services that I utilize in order to keep this website running, who, as you would expect, have varying degrees of commitment to user privacy. I do take into account the reputation of services that I utilize for my website. On the occasions that a third-party service's actions become unreasonable or egregious I am committed to finding an alternative solution. If you would like to assist in this regard, my [contact information](/contact) is readily available, and thank you in advance. 

In an effort to make things easier for the end-user I have compiled a list of all the services that help keep this sight afloat, with links to their respective privacy policies:

* [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement) - My hosting solution
* [Google Fonts](https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq/privacy) - Serves fonts to my site 
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/privacy) - Serves icons to my site

* [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/company/privacy) - A database solution that I use as a sort-of a CMS

In addition to the third party services I use, I have also compiled a quick collection of privacy policies for all of the social media sites that are linked to from this website:
