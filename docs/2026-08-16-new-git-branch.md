A guide for creating a new branch in a git repository.

# Creating a New Branch
1. Navigate to git repo: 
```bash
cd REPO
```

2. Create new branch: 
```bash
git checkout -b NEW-BRANCH
```

3. Push new branch: 
```bash
git push origin NEW-BRANCH
```

## (Optionally) Create a Branch from a Specific Commit 
```bash
git checkout -b NEW-BRANCH HASH
```

### Swap Between Branches
```bash
git checkout BRANCH-NAME
```

# Merge Changes to master/main Branch
1. Change back to main branch: 
```bash
git checkout master
```
2. Merge it: 
```bash
git merge branchNAME
```
